Summaries of Computer Vision and Machine Learning literature

Most of the papers here will be the ones I have encountered as a part of my research, as well as those read in classes such as CS 6476 and CS 7476 by James Hays, and CS 7616 by Henrik Christensen.

If you would like to submit a summary of some work you've recently read/reviewed, please feel free to drop me a Pull Request.
