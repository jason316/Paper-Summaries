## Dense Semantic Correspondence Where Every Pixel is a Classifier

The authors propose an exemplar classifier based method to perform dense semantic correspondence across different images that may have no spatial or temporal relationship (properties which are used in Stereo and Optical Flow).
In this paper, each SIFT keypoint is used to learn a classifier which then calculates the match likelihood of pixels in the target image in the feature space. The key challenge is to train the large number of classifiers, since dense SIFT sampling is performed. The authors use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to learn these classifiers using 2 important properties of the negative set which allows them to estimate the large number of classifiers efficiently. The authors then generate a hand annotated dataset to evaluate their method in comparison to state of the art techniques.
