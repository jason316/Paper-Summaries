In this paper, the authors propose using a CNN for generating images given high level abstractions such as class, transformation parameters and viewpoint. They define a network in uconv layers and un-pooling layers in order to achieve this objective, and try to generate meaningful images using rendered images as a training set.
The more interesting part of the paper though are the experiments and the analyses performed. The authors show not just how to generate images given high level information, but demonstrate new viewpoint generation, morphing of different object classes, interpolating new styles for a given class, performing feature space arithmetic with corresponding effects in the image and generating new images at random. The coolest results were that of the activation layer analyses, which showed that different neurons handled different aspects of the transformations, something which was explored in a previous paper. Both single neuron and neuron group activation analyses shed light on the inner workings of their network.
