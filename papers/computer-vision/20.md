## Fast R-CNN. 

#### Ross Girshick. ICCV 2015.

The author proposes Fast R-CNN, a Deep Network that has better performance and efficiency that its predecessors, R-CNN and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Nets aka SPPNets. This is accomplished by leveraging the shared computations of SPPNets along with the ROI layer in a novel training (or should I say fine-tuning?) approach which jointly ranks object proposals and generates posterior distributions in a single pass, rather than separate passes as was being done earlier. This leads to much faster training and testing time than previous networks used for object detection. Furthermore, the use of the softmax layer in favor of SVMs, and truncated SVD of the fully connected layer helps improve both performance nad efficiency. Various experiments are run on the VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 datasets to validate results.
