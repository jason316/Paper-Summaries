## Learning Visual Similarity for Product Design with Convolutional Neural Networks. 

#### Sean Bell, Kavita Bala. Siggraph 2015.

This paper presents the use of a Siamese CNN architecture to do multitask learning in order to figure out a good embedding of both in-situ and iconic product images. The tasks here are calculating an embedding of the images to minimize a contrastive loss as per a distance metric, and to predict the category of a product image. The authors explore the utility of their approach in visual similarity search for product images given in-situ images, in-situ images given product images and stylistically similar images. The training data is collected via crowdsourcing on the AMT framework. Different architectures and distance metrics are evaluated and their results presented.
