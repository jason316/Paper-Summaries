The entire process of creating a high-quality, high volume dataset is discussed with emphasis on a large number of categories and instances per category in the images, with focus given to non-iconic images so that object detection and scene understanding can be progressed in more natural settings. The paper talks about 3 types of computer vision tasks, Image Classification, Object Detection and Semantic Scene Labeling and uses them as guidelines to design the dataset. In-depth discussions of the creation process via crowdsourcing and statistics compared to other popular datasets are provided.

Questions:

1. What was the rough timeline and funding required to complete this dataset? If, suppose, I decide to create a dataset today for a particular vision task, how should I plan for time and costs?

2. There are some very good ideas regarding crowd worker approval and analyzing the annotation performance, but how do the authors know how much is good enough? There is a direct comparison with ground truths, but as mentioned, there is inherent ambiguity in object categories and instances, and we don't know how well these workers would have performed on other datasets or on similar tasks (though evidence seems to suggest they would do an equally good job, this is an interesting thought given the different objectives of MS COCO).
