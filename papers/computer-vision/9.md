## How do humans sketch objects? 

#### Mathias Eitz, James Hays, and Marc Alexa. Siggraph 2012.

The paper discusses a first-of-its-kind study of human sketch recognition, comparing computational models for classification against human ability as a baseline. The major contributions of this paper are the large and varied sketch dataset generated through crowdsourcing, the SIFT-like feature descriptor for the sketch images which performs amazingly well given its simplicity and an analysis of different models for performing the best classification of sketches. Applications and drawbacks of the research are provided.

Discussion:

1. Would using a more gamified crowdsourcing approach, such as the ESP game, lead to less confusion among humans for semantically similar categories?

2. While temporal order of sketches seems useful, how would you account for the fact that different users may have different starting points and have different hand preferences?

3. Previous papers use sketch gradient comparison. Was that considered as a possible feature representation?
