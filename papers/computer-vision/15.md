The authors of this paper provide an in-depth analysis of the different representations learned at each layer of the CNNs trained on ImageNet and Places Databases respectively. They run 2 experiments in particular, minimal image representations and empirical receptive fields, for each of the units in each of the layers to better understand what causes a unit to activate and how much does a segment influence the activation of a unit. They then plot the various "themes" and abstractions across various layers (obtained by our good friend, AMT) and show how various layers identify different abstractions.
