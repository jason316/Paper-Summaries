This paper presents a Deep Learning approach for finding separate content and style representations of an image. The authors use CNNs trained on object recognition to get content representations of objects which are robust to object variations and they use the correlations of these representations across the filter banks to compute a Gram matrix which represents the style of the image. Thus, they are able to abstract out the content from the style in 2 separate feature maps. Using these separate feature maps, the authors demonstrate using the content of one image and the style of another image (of an artwork) to generate novel and visually appealing images in a form of NPR.
