## Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning by Context Prediction. 

#### Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros. ICCV 2015. 

The paper presents the idea of training on a pretext task in order to learn a representation for other, related tasks. The pretext task in this case is learning relative spatial configurations of 2 patches from an image, thus allowing a self-supervised formulation to learning parts of objects. The authors use a late fusion architecture of 2 ConvNets and utilize techniques to correct for trivial solutions due to color aberrations. The key idea is to use one side of the network as a pretrained network and fine-tune it for object detection. Empirical results on the Pascal VOC 2007 show state of the art results using this pretrained formulation. The authors also show applicability across datasets and to the the task of unsupervised visual data mining.
