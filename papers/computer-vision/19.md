## Diagnosing error in object detectors. 

#### Derek Hoiem, Yodsawalai Chodpathumwan, and Qieyun Dai. ECCV 2012.

The paper demonstrates a detailed analysis of object detector performance, taking into account different types of false positives and the various characteristics of objects in different categories, such as occlusion, truncation, size, aspect ratio, etc. To enable this analysis without any sort of bias on the number of true positives, they define a new metric called Average Normalized Precision. The demonstrate an analysis across various types of false positives and different types of object characteristics using the object detectors by Felzenszwalb et al and Vedaldi et al, illustrating how each detector varies in performance based on the characteristics and how the detectors structure might be liable for the performance difference. This provides a good benchmark for researchers to base their detector analyses on.
