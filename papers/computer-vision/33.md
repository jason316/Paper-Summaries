## Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation. 

#### Ross Girshick, Jeff Donahue, Trevor Darrell, Jitendra Malik. 2014. 

This paper shows how deep networks trained on one task can be fine-tuned for another task for which training data may be limited. The authors use the base network trained for object classification and fine tune it to perform object detection and semantic segmentation.
