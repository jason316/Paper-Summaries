## Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. 

#### Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala. 2015. 

The authors utilize CNNs in the Generative Adversarial Network Framework in order to learn feature representations in an unsupervised fashion. The authors explore and analyze various models, providing guidelines and metrics for the best performing models. They then apply the latent representation learned by this framework in supervised tasks and show state of the art performance which is only lacking in comparison to purely supervised techniques.
