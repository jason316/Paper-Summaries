## DeepBox: Learning Objectness with Convolutional Networks. 

#### Weicheng Kuo, Bharath Hariharan, Jitendra Malik. ICCV 2015. 

This paper uses a lightweight Deep Network to effectively fine-tune rankings of object proposals obtained from bottom-up proposal techniques and rerank them. The idea here is for the network to gain an understanding of the notion of "objectness". The network is only 4 layers deep and was obtained by selectively removing parameters while trying to keep the performance of the network approximately the same. The training procedure for the DeepBox architecture seems to be more important. Here the authors train the network twice, once on samples from sliding window detectors, using overlap measures to label positive and negative samples, and the second time on actual proposals using the Edge Boxes technique, in order to learn tighter bounding boxes and differentiate between whole and part objects. Multiple experiments were run, showing 3 features of DeepBox - 1. Improves performance of the naive Edge Box technique, 2. Performs well even on categories it has never seen during training, and 3. Can be adapted to use other object proposal techniques such as Selective Search.
