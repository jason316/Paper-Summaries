## ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database. 

#### J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li and L. Fei-Fei. IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009 

The paper discusses the creation and objectives of ImageNet, a large scale, diverse image dataset which corresponds to the synsets of WordNet. The authors use Image Search Engine crawling along with Crowd Sourcing in conjunction with innovative algorithms to create the dataset, with 500-1000 images per synset. They run multiple experiments to validate why the large scale, clean and hierarchical structure of ImageNet proves useful for pushing the state of the art in terms of computer vision research.

Discussion:

1. The only dataset quantitatively compared is the TinyImages dataset. Would the results still hold on other more elaborate datasets such as MS COCO?

2. Would having the hierarchical structure actually help detection? One would intuitively imagine that sub categories would be harder to classify (and that is even mentioned that it is harder for humans to classify sub- and super-categories). I would imagine that attribute tagging would be a much better application and research area for this structure of ImageNet, and that has not been touched upon.
