## Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them. 

#### Aravindh Mahendran, Andrea Vedaldi. CVPR 2015. 

The authors aim to better understand the information contained in the different layers of CNNs by proposing a general method to trconstruct an image given the feature representation. They provide a regularized objective function, whose optimization gives the best possible reconstruction. For regularization, a natural image prior is provided to force the objective function to minimize in the space of natural images. They discuss the form of the objective function providing all the considerations. To find the optimal objective function, they use an extended version of gradient descent. This requires having the image representations be differential as composed in the loss function. This leads to the interesting part of the paper, where they show how DSIFT and HOG, classic shallow representations, can be modeled by CNNs faithfully and provide the convenient property of being able to calculate derivatives. Finally they run their method on the 3 CNNs and visualize the outputs to compare the amount of information in each.
