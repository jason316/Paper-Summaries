#### Judy Hoffman, Sergio Guadarrama, Eric Tzeng, Ronghang Hu, Jeff Donahue, Ross Girshick, Trevor Darrell, Kate Saenko. 2014. 

This paper discusses scaling of object detection to thousands of classes for which training data is unavailable. To do so, the authors adapt deep network object detectors from the objects for which training data exists to the the objects without training data using a nearest neighbor search of similar network activations.
This allows for a semi-supervised form of training of new object detectors for which training data is limited or does not exist.
