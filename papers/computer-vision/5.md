## CVPR 2014 Tutorial on Deep Learning. 

#### Graham Taylor, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, and Honglak Lee.

The introduction to Deep Learning section was a good refresher of all the topics discussed in CS 6476. The supervised deep learning tutorial provides a layer by layer examination of how a convolutional architecture works and why is it well suited for images and computer vision.

Questions:
1. A lot of the parameter tuning in Deep Learning has been termed "black magic" and needs some insightful understanding of how to design architectures. What are some of the key intuitions once can take away for designing architectures, especially given that Deep Learning generalizes well?

2. I have tried training a deep network from scratch in the past with little success. What would be your advice on various pitfalls when either training from scratch or augmenting an existing network?
