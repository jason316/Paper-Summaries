## Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation. 

#### Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer, Trevor Darrell. CVPR 2015. 

The paper introduces Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) as a machinery to do end-to-end semantic segmentation on arbitrarily sized images. This involves convolutionalizing the fully connected layers of existing networks and fine-tuning them to do segmentation. Dense predictions are obtained by providing a deconvolution layer to upsample output layers, where the upsampling filter can be learned. Dense, pixel-wise predictions are improved by providing a novel skip architecture that connects lower level predictions with higher level predictions.
