The paper introduces a new benchmark image dataset, Places, designed to incorporate all the scene categories from the SUN397 dataset plus many more and being competitive with teh ImageNet dataset in term of number of images per category and number of images overall. The authors introduce 2 novel measures to allow comparison of the datasets, relative diversity and relative density, and demonstrate how Places while being comparable in density, is more diverse than ImageNet and SUN397. The authors then show experimentally that a scene-centric Deep Network performs better than a object-centric Deep Network, by training their own CNN called Places-CNN and visualizing the difference between the units in the higher layers of each CNN, Places-CNN and ImageNet-CNN.
