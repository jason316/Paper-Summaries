## Visual Madlibs: Fill in the blank Description Generation and Question Answering. 

#### Licheng Yu, Eunbyung Park, Alexander C. Berg, Tamara L. Berg. ICCV, 2015.

This paper presents a new type of VQA dataset where instead of free form questions and answers, there are targeted and specific prompts for fill-in-the-blank style answers targeting various aspects of the image. The key idea in this paper is to provide a mechanism for more descriptive captions that target specific objects and attributes of the image, as well as be more amenable to evaluation via the multiple choice answers. The authors use template based madlib generation over MS COCO images and then use AMT to provide different answers for each question prompt type. Only human-centric images with accompanying objects are chosen to create the dataset. The authors analyze the madlib responses, compare its comprehensiveness and preciseness with MS COCO captions and evaluate metrics on the two tasks, visual madlib description generation and multiple choice question answering.
