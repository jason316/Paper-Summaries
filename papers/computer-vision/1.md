The paper discusses a data-driven, "what could have been there" approach to image completion or inpainting. The 3 main challenges of computational cost, semantic validity, and texture, color and illumination mismatch are tackled using 1. nearest neighbor search for matching scenes using gist descriptors with augmented color information helped by 2. the use of a very large (2.3M images) dataset of images and then completed plausibly using 3. graph cut seam finding over the gradient of image differences and Poisson blending for the valid local contexts. Both qualitative and quantitative results are provided.

1. Was part based matching examined? In the case where the algorithm fails due to a lack of high level semantic understanding, perhaps an approach involving completion of parts of the hole could provide better solutions?

2. Why is a 80 pixels radius used for the local context? Is that an empirical finding or is there some justification from a computational standpoint?
