## AverageExplorer: Interactive Exploration and Alignment of Visual Data Collections. 

#### Jun-Yan Zhu, Yong Jae Lee, Alexei Efros. Siggraph 2014. 

The authors present in this paper a tool to interactively visualize large, internet-scale image datasets via the medium of average images. The novelty of their approach is that they favor a human-in-the-loop process, using human user "brush strokes" and cues to adaptively weigh each image in the dataset and then compute the "weighted average image", made possible via a real time user interface. The tools they provide the user are 1. a coloring brush to specify desired colors, 2. a sketching brush to highlight which parts of the image are more important, 3. a explorer brush to select which region of an average image the AverageExplorer should find more matches for and 4. a tool to interactively cluster images based on the average image after a set of user edits. They show qualitatively that AverageExplorer gives sharper average images that various other contemporary techniques, and they also demonstrate via user studies the representative power of their technique and its ease of use.
